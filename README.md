# IQuestCookBook
We're going to build an awesome cook book! :)

The app should be responsive and must look good at least on safari mobile latest and chrome (desktop) latest.
Please look at the screenshots for guidance. The required minimum width should be 320px and the maximum +Infinity :).
No library/framework is needed except fontawesome for the icons (http://fontawesome.io/get-started/) so please no bootstrap or similar, only html/css is allowed

You should already have a github account created with the email address used for iQuest University - Remote Learning (on slack).
Create a new repo (name of your choice) and inside the repo create index.html and a style.css. You can commit the fontawesome lib for the icons but I strongly recommend using the cdn version (ask if you have troubles using it).
So the repo should only contain the two files above and .gitignore. Nothing else.

Colors used are the following:
- header bg color: #d94e44 - this appeaers only in the header;
- the other red-ish color: #db4d3f;
- navigation separator color: #d6d4d4 - the grey lines;
- body bg color: #f9f9f9;
- form sections bg color: #f6f4f4;
Font awesome icons used:
- fa-cutlery for header;
- fa-plus for "New recipe" button in navigation;
- fa-info for "About" section of the form;
- fa-list for "Ingredients" section of the form;
- fa-plus-square for add ingredient;
- fa-list-ol for "Steps" section of the form;
- fa-trash-o for "Cancel" button;
- fa-floppy-o for "Save recipe" button;

Max width of the form should be 1000px and the header (including navigation) should be liquid (expand as needed).
Navigation sections should be equal and navigation controls should be centered both horizontally and vertically.
That's about it, if you have further questions don't hesitate to ask me (Dragos).

PS: When the width permits there is an "of" between "Qty." and "Unit" in the "Ingredients" section ;)

Good luck, have fun!
